    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> 
    <p>
      dacape.dev built the Snoutly app as an ad-supported app.  
      This SERVICE is provided by dacape.dev at no cost and is intended for use as is.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page informs visitors of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone using Snoutly.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using Snoutly, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
      Because Snoutly uses advertising (AdMob), certain data may be collected by third-party providers to show personalized or non-personalized ads.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Important Notice – Not for Children</strong></p>
    <p>
      Snoutly is <strong>not intended for users under the age of 16</strong>.  
      The app includes advertising via AdMob, which may collect data that is not appropriate for a child-directed service.  
      If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used Snoutly, please uninstall the app immediately.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
    <p>
      Snoutly processes dog breed identification locally on your device using offline machine learning models.  
      <strong>No photos are uploaded or stored on external servers</strong>.  
      However, because the app uses Google AdMob, advertising partners may collect data such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., AAID)</li>
        <li>Approximate location</li>
        <li>Device information (model, OS, language)</li>
        <li>Interaction with ads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data collection is handled exclusively by third-party ad providers and is subject to their privacy policies.
    </p>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Services</strong></p>
        <p>
            Snoutly uses the following third-party services that may collect information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AdMob</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
    <p>
      In case of an error, the app may collect technical data via third-party tools such as crash reporting services.  
      This may include the device model, OS version, app state at crash, and the time of the event.  
      No images or personal content are included in crash logs.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
      Snoutly does not use cookies directly, but AdMob and Google services may use cookies or similar technologies to improve ad performance.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
    <p>
      We may employ third-party companies to provide infrastructure, analytics, or advertising.  
      These parties may have access to anonymous technical data only to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to use it for other purposes.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>
      Although Snoutly does not collect photos or personal content, we value your trust.  
      However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
    <p>
      Snoutly may contain links to external websites.  
      We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
    <p>
      Snoutly is <strong>not directed at children under 16</strong>.  
      Because the app includes advertising and third-party data collection, it is not suitable for minors.  
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>

      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
