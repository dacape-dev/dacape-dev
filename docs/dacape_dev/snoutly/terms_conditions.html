  <strong>Terms & Conditions</strong>

  <p>
    By downloading or using Snoutly, you agree to these Terms and Conditions.  
    Please read them carefully before using the app.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may not copy, modify, translate, reverse engineer, or create derivative
    versions of the app, except where permitted by applicable law.
    The app, including its trademarks, code, machine learning models, and content,
    remains the intellectual property of <strong>dacape.dev</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    dacape.dev is committed to ensuring Snoutly is as useful and reliable as
    possible. We reserve the right to update or change the app at any time.
    If we ever introduce paid features, we will clearly communicate what is being purchased.
  </p>

  <p>
    Snoutly processes dog breed classification entirely offline on your device
    and is intended for informational and entertainment purposes only.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app also uses third-party services such as Google AdMob, Firebase Analytics,
    and Firebase Crashlytics, which may collect technical and usage-related data
    as described in our Privacy Policy.
  </p>


  <div>
    <p><strong>Third-Party Terms</strong></p>
    <p>
      Snoutly uses third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AdMob</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <p>
    Snoutly may require an internet connection for loading ads and third-party services.
    dacape.dev cannot be held responsible if the app does not function fully due to
    lack of connectivity or data limitations.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you use the app outside Wi-Fi coverage, your mobile operator’s charges may apply,
    including roaming fees if applicable. By using Snoutly, you accept responsibility for
    any such charges. If you are not the owner of the device, we assume you have permission
    from the bill payer.
  </p>

  <p>
    dacape.dev is not responsible if the app fails to function due to battery loss,
    improper device configuration, or actions outside our control.
  </p>

  <p>
    While we make efforts to keep Snoutly updated and accurate, we rely on third-party components
    and services. dacape.dev cannot be held liable for losses, direct or indirect, resulting from
    reliance on the app’s functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may update Snoutly from time to time. Requirements for Android (or any future platforms)
    may change, and you are responsible for installing updates to continue using the app.  
    dacape.dev does not guarantee ongoing compatibility with all device models or OS versions.

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Age Requirement</strong></p>
  <p>
    Snoutly is <strong>not intended for users under 16 years of age</strong>, due to advertising
